Program Description: This is a program that emulates the console project of the same name that we did during the coding combine. It's an API program that takes in two number inputs from the user, adds them together, and then shows the user the product.

Peer Review By: Reed Goodwin - I This is a well written piece of code! functions as intended, I like how it tells you the two numbers you added.

How To Instuctions:
1) Load the program into VSCode.
2) Start Debugging.
3) Copy Local Host URL from the console (e.g. "http://localhost:5264")
4) Open Postman program and paste the copied URL into a new workspace, with the "GET" input field.
5) Append the URL with "Add2NumbersEndpoint/Add2Numbers/{num1}/{num2}"
6) Replace "{num1}" with any whole number, and so the same with "{num2}". Hit the "Send" button to the right of the input field.
